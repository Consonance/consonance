CONSONANCE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE - INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------
This tool will setup a "launcher" host which has all of the infrastructure we used to align and variant call
the PanCancer donors.  This launcher host can then launch one or more worker VMs to launch generic tools 
and workflows registered on Dockstore.

This system requires the following:
* Docker support in your Linux distribution (Ubuntu 14.04 is officially supported by the Consonance Launcher).
* AWS credentials, if you are using Amazon EC2.
MSG

## Commented text
#* A GNOS key (or keys) which are used to both download Docker images for our workflows, dependencies, as well as data from from GNOS servers used in the project.
#  Please ensure that these files are in ~/.gnos
#* Alternatively (or in addition to) the GNOS keys, a token for downloading workflows, dependencies, as well as donor data files from S3.


# Ask the user a question and save the answer.
# They MUST give an answer, they cannot leave their answer blank. In the future, that could be parameterized...
# $1 - the question string
# $2 - the previous value
# $3 - the name of the value
# $4 - reference to the user's answer.
